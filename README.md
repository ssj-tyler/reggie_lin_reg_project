# reggie_lin_reg_project
The (in)famous "Reggie's Linear Regression" project from Codecademy, originally completed in July 2022.

This project essentially has you create a linear regression function from scratch, going through how to code a basic y=mx+b line, how to find error, how to minimize that error, and how to apply these functions to any data point you come across thereafter.

This was a particularly frustrating project at the time because this project is sprung on you when, in the event you lack the higher math background like I did, linear regression in principle can be hard to wrap your head around as far as *why* it's important. It's only now months later looking back, compared to what else I've learned, that the use-cases and principles behind linear regression make much more sense. It's also made me more grateful for Sci-kit Learn which does all of this for me. :)
